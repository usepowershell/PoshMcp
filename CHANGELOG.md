# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented here.

## [0.8.11] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- `poshmcp build` now works correctly when run outside the PoshMcp repository directory. The embedded Dockerfile is now materialized to a temporary file before invoking docker, preventing "Dockerfile not found" errors.

## [0.8.10] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- `--appsettings` option for `poshmcp build` command allows users to bundle a local `appsettings.json` file into their container image at build time, simplifying configuration management in containerized deployments.

## [0.8.9] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- `examples/Dockerfile.user` now includes documented PSModule paths showing where PowerShell modules are available in the container (`/usr/local/share/powershell/Modules` for AllUsers, `/opt/microsoft/powershell/7/Modules` for built-in, `/home/appuser/.local/share/powershell/Modules` for CurrentUser).
- Commented `COPY` directive examples in `Dockerfile.user` demonstrating how to easily copy local modules and startup scripts into the container.

## [0.8.8] - 2026-04-24

### Changed
- `poshmcp build --generate-dockerfile` now emits a user deployment template based on the published `ghcr.io/usepowershell/poshmcp/poshmcp` base image instead of the source build Dockerfile
- `install-modules.ps1` is now bundled in the base container image at `/app/install-modules.ps1` — generated Dockerfiles no longer require users to have this script locally
- `examples/Dockerfile.user` updated to reference the bundled script path and use the published base image

### Fixed
- Generated Dockerfile was incorrectly using the base image's own source Dockerfile as the template
