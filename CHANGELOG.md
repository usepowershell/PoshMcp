# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented here.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- **Program.cs maintainability refactor** — Extracted major concerns into dedicated classes: `SettingsResolver`, `ConfigurationFileManager`, `CommandHandlers`, `DoctorService`, `McpToolSetupService`, `StdioServerHost`, `HttpServerHost`, `CliDefinition`, and `LoggingHelpers`. Achieves 73% reduction in `Program.cs` lines (from ~800 to ~210), improving maintainability and testability.

### Improved
- **Authentication/OAuth reliability wins**
  - RequiredRoles: Now uses OR semantics - users need any one configured role instead of all.
  - MapInboundClaims: Disabled to preserve short JWT claim names (`scp`, `roles`) for consistent policy enforcement.
  - RequiredScopes: Standardized to short names (e.g., `user_impersonation`) matching JWT claim format.
  - RFC 9728 headers: 401 challenge now includes `WWW-Authenticate` `resource_metadata` header and `/token` proxy strips legacy `resource` parameter.
- **Documentation improvements** — Updated Entra ID authentication guides with scope naming clarifications and improved OAuth configuration guidance.
- **Tests: 590 passed, 0 failed, 1 skipped ✅ | Format verification passed ✅**

## [0.9.21] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed
- **Tests: DoctorReport role claim lookup** — Updated `DoctorReportTests` to use `"roles"` as the claim type instead of `ClaimTypes.Role` (WS-Federation long URI). Required after `MapInboundClaims = false` was enabled in v0.9.20, which caused `DoctorReport.cs` to look up roles by their short JWT claim name. All 590 tests now pass.

## [0.9.20] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed
- **Authentication: OR semantics for RequiredRoles checks** — `HasRequiredRoles()` now uses `.Any()` instead of `.All()`, so a user needs any one of the configured roles rather than all of them. This matches ASP.NET Core's built-in `policy.RequireRole(string[])` behavior and correctly handles Entra app roles, which are granted individually.
- **Authentication: JWT claim-type remapping disabled** — Added `MapInboundClaims = false` to JWT Bearer options to prevent ASP.NET Core from remapping short JWT claim names (`scp`, `roles`) to WS-Federation long URIs. This fixes policy checks that were silently failing because `FindAll("scp")` returned empty after remapping.
- **Authentication: RequiredScopes format corrected** — `RequiredScopes` config value now uses the short scope name (`user_impersonation`) as it appears in the JWT `scp` claim, not the full URI form (`api://{appid}/user_impersonation`) that Entra strips during token issuance.
- **Diagnostics: Role claim lookup in DoctorReport** — Updated `DoctorReport.cs` to use `FindAll("roles")` (short name) instead of `FindAll(ClaimTypes.Role)` (WS-Fed URI), consistent with `MapInboundClaims = false`.

## [0.9.4] - 2026-05-01

### Fixed
- **OAuth discovery for VS Code MCP clients:** JwtBearer 401 challenge now includes `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata="{url}"` per RFC 9728, enabling VS Code to discover the Protected Resource Metadata endpoint and correctly redirect OAuth flows to Entra ID instead of to PoshMcp's own base URL.
- **ApiKey handler metadata URL:** Fixed invalid `api://` URI being used for PRM URL construction; now correctly uses `{scheme}://{host}/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`.

## [0.9.3] - 2026-05-01

### Fixed
- **Security: Authentication bypass (second instance)** — `WebApplicationBuilder` loads the container's baked-in `appsettings.json` (which has `Authentication.Enabled: false` as a default) before the custom configuration file is added. The custom file's `Enabled: true` was silently overridden by the base file. All auth middleware gates checked this overridden value, resulting in `UseAuthentication()`, `UseAuthorization()`, and `RequireAuthorization("McpAccess")` being skipped despite correct configuration. Fixed by building a dedicated `authRootConfig` via `ConfigurationLoader.BuildRootConfiguration()` using only the resolved custom config path — the same source the `poshmcp doctor` and `get-configuration-troubleshooting` tools already use. All three auth call sites now read from this consistent source, ensuring what doctor reports matches what the runtime enforces.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-05-01

### Fixed
- **Security: Authentication bypass** — `AddPoshMcpAuthentication()` was not registering `AuthenticationConfiguration` with the .NET options system (`services.Configure<>()`). As a result, `IOptions<AuthenticationConfiguration>` always resolved to its default value (`Enabled = false`) regardless of `appsettings.json` settings. The middleware gates (`UseAuthentication`, `UseAuthorization`) and endpoint authorization (`RequireAuthorization("McpAccess")`) were silently skipped, allowing unauthenticated requests through even when `Authentication.Enabled: true` was configured. Fixed by adding `services.Configure<AuthenticationConfiguration>()` unconditionally in `AddPoshMcpAuthentication()`.
- Adds 3 regression tests in `AuthenticationServiceExtensionsTests` covering auth-enabled, auth-disabled, and missing-section scenarios.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-05-01

### Added
- **Authentication and identity diagnostics in doctor/troubleshooting tool** — Both `poshmcp doctor` and the `get-configuration-troubleshooting` MCP tool now include:
  - `authentication` section: enabled state, configured scheme types (JWT Bearer / API Key), authority/audience presence, key count (no secrets), default policy scopes and roles, protected resource URI, and CORS origins
  - `identity` section: caller identity when available in HTTP context — authenticated state, authentication scheme, name, scopes, and roles; `available: false` in CLI/stdio contexts where no HTTP context exists

### Removed
- `ConfigurationTroubleshootingTools.cs` dead code class — was never instantiated; real implementation lives in `CreateConfigurationTroubleshootingToolInstance` in `Program.cs`

## [0.9.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added
- **Application Insights integration** — Optional Azure Application Insights telemetry via OpenTelemetry. Enable with `ApplicationInsights.Enabled: true` in `appsettings.json`.
- `ApplicationInsightsOptions` configuration model with `Enabled`, `ConnectionString`, and `SamplingPercentage` properties.
- `ConfigureApplicationInsights()` method registers Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry when enabled, with support for connection string from config or `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable.
- Configurable sampling percentage (1–100) to control telemetry volume.
- `poshmcp doctor` validation for Application Insights configuration — validates connection string format and sampling range without network calls.
- 6 unit tests for `ConfigureApplicationInsights` covering enabled/disabled states, env var fallback, and sampling config.
- 4 integration tests for HTTP server with Application Insights enabled covering startup, logging, health endpoints, and tool discovery.
- `Azure.Monitor.OpenTelemetry.AspNetCore 1.4.0` package reference.

## [0.8.11] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- `poshmcp build` now works correctly when run outside the PoshMcp repository directory. The embedded Dockerfile is now materialized to a temporary file before invoking docker, preventing "Dockerfile not found" errors.

## [0.8.10] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- `--appsettings` option for `poshmcp build` command allows users to bundle a local `appsettings.json` file into their container image at build time, simplifying configuration management in containerized deployments.

## [0.8.9] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- `examples/Dockerfile.user` now includes documented PSModule paths showing where PowerShell modules are available in the container (`/usr/local/share/powershell/Modules` for AllUsers, `/opt/microsoft/powershell/7/Modules` for built-in, `/home/appuser/.local/share/powershell/Modules` for CurrentUser).
- Commented `COPY` directive examples in `Dockerfile.user` demonstrating how to easily copy local modules and startup scripts into the container.

## [0.8.8] - 2026-04-24

### Changed
- `poshmcp build --generate-dockerfile` now emits a user deployment template based on the published `ghcr.io/usepowershell/poshmcp/poshmcp` base image instead of the source build Dockerfile
- `install-modules.ps1` is now bundled in the base container image at `/app/install-modules.ps1` — generated Dockerfiles no longer require users to have this script locally
- `examples/Dockerfile.user` updated to reference the bundled script path and use the published base image

### Fixed
- Generated Dockerfile was incorrectly using the base image's own source Dockerfile as the template
