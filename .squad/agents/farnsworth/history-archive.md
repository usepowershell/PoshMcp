## Learnings (Recent)

### 2025-07-17: PR #135 — Program.cs extraction quality (items 1-4)

**Task:** Reviewed PR #135 which extracts `LoggingHelpers`, `DockerRunner`, `SettingsResolver`, `ConfigurationFileManager`, and `ConfigurationLoader` from Program.cs.

**Key observations:**
- All extractions were complete and correct — every method and type listed in the plan for items 1–4 appeared in its designated file with no omissions.
- The decision to combine PRs A–D into one PR was sound: all four are "safe" extractions (pure function moves, no instance state), so there was no behavioral risk to combining them.
- Call sites updated consistently throughout Program.cs — no stale direct method calls left behind.
- Namespace (`namespace PoshMcp;`) and visibility (`internal static`) were uniform across all five new files. Zero accidental public surface.
- Build: 0 errors, 0 warnings. Tests not explicitly run, but build green is a strong indicator.
- Only note: `ExitCodeRuntimeError = 4` is duplicated as `private const` in both `Program.cs` and `DockerRunner.cs`. Harmless, but a candidate for a shared constants class in a later sweep.
- `Program.cs` is ~2,100 lines post-extraction — expected at this stage. The big reductions come in PRs E–H (doctor, tool setup, server hosts, CLI tree).

**Verdict:** APPROVED. Extraction quality is high. Pattern is replicable for PRs E–I.

### 2025-07-18: Program.cs refactor plan authored

**Task:** Full read of Program.cs (~3,480 lines) and all other .cs files in PoshMcp.Server. Produced working refactor plan at `specs/program-cs-refactor.md`.

**Key findings:**
- Program.cs owns 12 distinct concerns — CLI tree, command handlers, settings resolution, config file I/O, config loading, doctor diagnostics, MCP tool setup, stdio server startup, HTTP server startup, Docker process commands, logging utilities, and inline model types.
- All methods are `private static` or `internal static` with no instance state — extractions are pure method moves with no behavioral risk.
- Two genuine care points: (1) `args` is closed over in SetHandler lambdas — must be threaded explicitly when extracting handlers; (2) `ConfigureJsonSerializerOptions`/`RegisterCleanupServices` are duplicated for both builder types — deduplicate via a shared `Action<>` delegate.
- Static mutable state on `McpToolFactoryV2.SetMetrics`, `PowerShellAssemblyGenerator.SetMetrics/SetRuntimeCachingState/SetConfiguration` is a pre-existing anti-pattern — explicitly deferred from this refactor.
- `UpgradeConfigWithMissingDefaultsAsync` is a side-effecting call embedded inside config path resolution — intentional coupling, move both methods together rather than decoupling.

**Proposed breakdown:** 10 new files, 9 incremental PRs, Program.cs target ≤200 lines.

**Decision inbox entry:** `.squad/decisions/inbox/farnsworth-program-cs-refactor.md`

### 2026-07-18: Issue #131 — STDIO logging architecture review

**Design ownership:** Created comprehensive architecture spec (farnsworth-131-stdio-logging-design.md) defining:
- Problem: stdio transport must not pollute MCP JSON-RPC stream with console logging
- Solution: Serilog file-backed logging with 3-tier resolution (CLI > env > config > silent)
- New dependencies: Serilog.Extensions.Hosting, Serilog.Extensions.Logging, Serilog.Sinks.File
- ConfigureStdioLogging method with ClearProviders unconditional suppression
- OTel console exporter guarded by isStdioMode parameter

**PR #132 Review:** Comprehensive code review across all team contributions:
- Verified ClearProviders unconditionally prevents stdio pollution
- Validated Serilog file sink configuration (rolling daily, 7-day retention, output template)
- Confirmed resolution tier precedence (CLI > env > appsettings > silent)
- Checked OTel console exporter guarded by isStdioMode (HTTP path unchanged)
- Reviewed test coverage (10 tests, full suite 487/0/1 pass)
- Validated documentation updates (README + DOCKER with all three config options)

**Verdict:** APPROVED - Implementation matches design spec. Ship it.

### 2026-07-14: MCP authentication architecture design

**Decision:** Implement two-layer authentication for HTTP transport:
1. **ASP.NET Core middleware** validates identity (JWT Bearer tokens, API keys) → populates `HttpContext.User`
2. **MCP SDK `CallToolFilters`** enforce per-tool authorization via `FunctionOverrides` config (scopes, roles, anonymous bypass)

**Architecture rationale:**
- Use `McpRequestFilters.CallToolFilters` (not `DelegatingMcpServerTool` wrappers) — cross-cutting, direct access to `User` and tool names, pairs with `ListToolsFilters` for consistent visibility
- Standard ASP.NET Core auth stack (not custom MCP-layer parsing) — SDK's `MessageContext.User` proves this is the intended integration point
- Multi-scheme support: JWT Bearer (spec compliance, enterprise) + API Key (simplicity)
- Disabled by default (`Authentication.Enabled = false`) for backward compatibility
- Stdio transport skips HTTP auth per MCP spec, but `CallToolFilters` still enforce tool-level policy

**Implementation scope:**
- New `Authentication` config section with `Enabled`, `Schemes`, `DefaultPolicy`
- `FunctionOverride` extends existing pattern with `RequiredScopes`, `RequiredRoles`, `AllowAnonymous`
- `Program.cs` gains conditional auth middleware in HTTP pipeline
- RFC 9728 protected resource metadata endpoint: `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`
- New dependency: `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer`

### 2026-07-15: PR #83 re-review (auth metrics Phase 6)

**Verdict:** APPROVED
**Issue resolved:** McpMetrics dual-instance bug fixed by Bender. Auth filters now registered as DI singletons with factory lambdas resolving `McpMetrics` via `sp.GetRequiredService<McpMetrics>()`. No manual `new McpMetrics()` construction in auth path. Deferred capture pattern for filter variables (assigned post-`app.Build()`) is safe — lambdas execute only at request time.
**Non-blocking nit:** Redundant LINQ lookup in `ApiKeyAuthenticationHandler` (`Options.Keys.FirstOrDefault(k => k.Key == apiKey).Key` after `TryGetValue` already succeeded).
**Build:** 0 errors on branch.

### 2026-07-15: Batch PR review session (PRs #92–#96)

**Reviewed 5 PRs, 4 approved, 1 rejected:**

| PR | Author | Verdict | Summary |
|----|--------|---------|---------|
| #92 | Amy | ✅ APPROVED | `--use-default-display-properties` flag — clean pattern adherence |
| #93 | Bender | ✅ APPROVED | Auth-enabled warning — minimal, advisory-only, stderr |
| #94 | Fry | ✅ APPROVED | 12 unit tests for update-config flags — comprehensive coverage |
| #95 | Hermes | ✅ APPROVED | Unserializable type filtering — solid 3-tier handling with 33 tests |
| #96 | Hermes | ❌ REJECTED | Doctor resolution diagnosis — `DiagnoseMissingCommands` called twice in JSON path |

**PR #96 rejection rationale:** `RunDoctorAsync` enriches `configuredFunctionStatus` with resolution reasons, then passes the list to `BuildDoctorJson` which independently calls `DiagnoseMissingCommands` again. Each call creates an `IsolatedPowerShellRunspace` and runs `Get-Command`/`Import-Module` per missing command. Fix: guard in `BuildDoctorJson` to skip when `ResolutionReason` is already populated. Assigned to Bender per rejection lockout.

**Cross-PR observations:**
- PRs #92, #93, #96 all modify `Program.cs` from same base (`bb35363`). Different line ranges — no merge conflicts expected but must merge sequentially.
- No PR touches `PoshMcp.Server.csproj` — no compatibility concerns with recent csproj edits.
- PR #94 depends on PR #85's flags being on `main` (already merged) — no ordering concern.
- PR #95 is self-contained (new files + `PowerShellAssemblyGenerator.cs`) — can merge independently.

### 2026-07-15: PR #96 re-review — approved and merged



### 2025-07-17: PR #135 re-review — second pass confirmation

**PR:** #135 — `refactor: extract LoggingHelpers, DockerRunner, SettingsResolver, ConfigurationFileManager, ConfigurationLoader from Program.cs`
**Verdict:** APPROVED (comment — self-approval blocked by GitHub)

**Second-pass validation (independent of Steven's self-review):**
- Verified all 5 files contain exactly the methods specified in items 1–4 of `specs/program-cs-refactor.md`
- Scanned all 60+ call sites in Program.cs — every one uses the new class prefix (`LoggingHelpers.`, `DockerRunner.`, `SettingsResolver.`, `ConfigurationFileManager.`, `ConfigurationLoader.`). Zero stale unqualified calls.
- Confirmed no method definitions are duplicated between Program.cs and the new files via `private static|internal static` scan.
- Namespace (`namespace PoshMcp;`) and visibility (`internal static`) uniform across all 5 files.
- Program.cs is 2,100 lines — expected intermediate state. Bulk reduction in PRs E–H.
- `ExitCodeRuntimeError = 4` duplication noted again (Program.cs + DockerRunner.cs). Non-blocking. Candidate for shared constants.
- `args` closure, static mutable state, `UpgradeConfigWithMissingDefaultsAsync` coupling — all handled per plan.

**Pattern for future PRs:** The combined A–D approach worked well for "safe" extractions (pure function moves). PRs E–G (doctor, tool setup, server hosts) have more cross-cutting dependencies and should be individual PRs as the plan recommends.



### 2025-07-18: PR #138 review — approved (Dockerfile restore/build fix)

**PR:** #138 (fixes #136) — `fix(#136): Fix Dockerfile restore/build`
**Verdict:** APPROVED

**Fix:** Two-line change: `dotnet restore PoshMcp.sln` → `dotnet restore PoshMcp.Server/PoshMcp.csproj`, `dotnet build PoshMcp.sln` → `dotnet build PoshMcp.Server/PoshMcp.csproj`. Fixes container build failure when only PoshMcp.Server.csproj is copied in the early layer but restore/build targeted the full solution (which references TestClient and PoshMcp.Tests not present in the container).

**Non-blocking nit:** `COPY PoshMcp.sln ./` on line 9 is now dead weight — no build command references it. Candidate for cleanup.



### 2025-07-18: PR #139 review — approved (doctor config coverage)

**PR:** #139 (fixes #137) — `feat(#137): Add auth, logging, env vars, MCP definitions to doctor`
**Verdict:** APPROVED

**Implementation quality:** 4 new diagnostic sections in both text and JSON output. 12 tests with well-designed disposable helpers (`DoctorConfigFile`, `DoctorConsoleCapture`, `DoctorEnvVarScope`). All 7 env vars covered. `BuildDoctorJson` new parameters use `= null` defaults with null-coalescing fallback — zero impact on existing callers. `[Collection("TransportSelectionTests")]` correctly prevents parallel execution. No trailing whitespace.

**Non-blocking nits:**
1. `TryLoadResourcesAndPromptsDefinitions` called unconditionally in `BuildDoctorJson` even when both values pre-supplied — should be guarded like auth/logging 3 lines above (same class of issue as PR #96 rejection, but much lower cost).
2. `POSHMCP_LOG_FILE` (added in PR #132) absent from env vars list — follow-up candidate.

**Pattern noted:** The precomputed-optional-parameter pattern (from PR #96) continues to be the correct approach for `BuildDoctorJson` — compute expensive data once in `RunDoctorAsync`, pass via optional params, let `BuildDoctorJson` self-compute only when called standalone.

## Cross-Agent: PR Review Approved (2026-04-20)

- Amy fixed PR #138 feedback (worktree poshmcp-136) 
- Bender fixed PR #139 feedback (worktree poshmcp-137)
- Both PRs approved with nits resolved


## Archived 2026-05-05 (history summarization, lines 201-281 of pre-summarization file)

- ComputeStatus: `errors > warnings > healthy` precedence per FR-102
- ResolvedSetting: `value`/`source` pairs per FR-107

**Must-fix nits (3):**
1. MCP tool description says "Outputs structured text by default; pass argument '--json'" — tool always returns JSON, no format argument exists. Misleading to LLM clients.
2. `POSHMCP_LOG_FILE` missing from `CollectEnvironmentVariables` — FR-113 violation, flagged since PR #139.
3. `POSHMCP_CONFIG` should be `POSHMCP_CONFIGURATION` in `CollectEnvironmentVariables` — pre-existing bug; `SettingsResolver.cs` defines the env var as `POSHMCP_CONFIGURATION`.

**Non-blocking observations:**
- `✖` (U+2716) vs `✗` (U+2717) inconsistency in `RenderMcpDefinitions` vs `StatusSymbol`
- Auth/logging config removed from output (technically FR-109 information loss, but defensible per spec's "placeholder" language)
- Extra env vars added beyond spec's 8 (POSHMCP_FUNCTION_NAMES, POSHMCP_COMMAND_NAMES, DOTNET_ENVIRONMENT) — additive, fine

## [2026-04-23T15:08:26] Deploy Source Image Spec

**Session:** Deploy source image support implementation (spec 007)
**Contribution:** Authored specification for -SourceImage parameter support

**Key Learnings:**
- Spec document: specs/007-deploy-source-image/spec.md
- Defines parameters for source image support in deploy.ps1
- Coordinated with Amy (implementation) and Fry (testing)

**Artifacts:** specs/007-deploy-source-image/spec.md



### 2026-04-23: Added session-recall skill

Created `.squad/skills/session-recall/SKILL.md` — project-level skill documenting the `session-recall` CLI tool for coordinator startup context recovery. Covers the lean 3-command startup sequence, how to pass recovered context into spawn prompts, fallback to the SQL-based `session-recovery` template skill, and anti-patterns. This is the preferred pattern over raw `session_store` SQL queries when the CLI is installed.

### 2026-04-25: Spec 008 — Application Insights Logging directory structure

**Actions taken:**
- Created `specs/008-application-insights-logging/` directory with `spec.md`, `tasks.md`, `checklists/requirements.md`
- Deleted old flat spec file from repository root
- Committed and pushed to main

**Result:** Spec 008 now in speckit format matching specs 001–007 naming and structure convention.

## Learnings

Spec: Application Insights optional logging — proposed Azure.Monitor.OpenTelemetry.AspNetCore integration, config-driven opt-in via appsettings ApplicationInsights section. File: specs/008-application-insights-logging/spec.md

## 2026-04-27: Reviewed Wave 1 PRs #176 and #177

**PR #176** (Azure.Monitor.OpenTelemetry.AspNetCore package): ✅ APPROVED
- Package Azure.Monitor.OpenTelemetry.AspNetCore v1.4.0 correctly added per FR-306
- Modern OpenTelemetry-based SDK (not legacy Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.AspNetCore)
- Build: 0 errors, 9 warnings (pre-existing)

**PR #177** (ApplicationInsights config section and binding model): ✅ APPROVED
- ApplicationInsightsOptions class correctly implements binding model
- Defaults spec-compliant: Enabled=false (FR-300), ConnectionString="" (FR-301), SamplingPercentage=100 (FR-302)
- SectionName constant = "ApplicationInsights"
- XML documentation on all public members
- appsettings.json includes ApplicationInsights section with Enabled: false (FR-318)
- Build: 0 errors, 9 warnings (pre-existing)

Both PRs ready to merge. Wave 1 infrastructure complete for spec 008.

### 2026-04-28: PR #180 review — REQUEST CHANGES (ConfigureApplicationInsights integration)

**PR:** #180 (branch: squad/172-configure-app-insights) — `feat: ConfigureApplicationInsights() in Program.cs`
**Verdict:** ❌ REQUEST CHANGES — return to original author

**What passes:**
- Core plumbing correct: `UseAzureMonitor()` with connection string, sampling, resource attributes
- FR-303/304/305/306/307/308/309/316/317/318 all satisfied
- Method signature exact match to spec
- Placement after `ConfigureOpenTelemetry*` is architecturally sound
- `AddOpenTelemetry()` idempotency correctly leveraged

**What fails:**
1. **FR-310 (BLOCKING):** Tool parameter names NOT added as custom properties — no enrichment mechanism exists. Needs Activity tags or ITelemetryInitializer in the tool execution path.
2. **FR-311 (BLOCKING):** `UseAzureMonitor()` enables OTel log export by default. Existing code at `PowerShellAssemblyGenerator.cs:731-738` logs parameter VALUES at Debug level. While filtered by default log level, spec says MUST NOT — requires defensive suppression.
3. **FR-312 (BLOCKING):** Same log export concern for PowerShell command output.

**Recommended fix:** Suppress OTel log export in `UseAzureMonitor` config (only export traces + metrics). Add Activity tags for parameter names (comma-separated list, no values). This satisfies FR-310/311/312 without touching the existing logging infrastructure.

**Key insight:** `UseAzureMonitor()` does three things: traces + metrics + logs export. For PoshMcp, we only want traces + metrics. The log exporter creates a security surface where Debug-level ILogger entries (containing parameter values per existing code) could leak to Azure Monitor if an operator adjusts log levels.

### PR #96 fix-pattern fragment (continuation from earlier archive)
**PR:** #96 (Hermes original, Bender fix) — `feat: surface resolution reasons for missing commands in poshmcp doctor`
**Outcome:** Squash merged to `main`. Branch `squad/91-doctor-commands-resolved` deleted (remote). Fixes #91.

**Fix pattern (Bender's second commit):**
- `RunDoctorAsync` now calls `DiagnoseMissingCommands` once, enriches `configuredFunctionStatus` records with `ResolutionReason`, then passes the list to `BuildDoctorJson` via new optional `precomputedFunctionStatus` parameter.
- `BuildDoctorJson` uses `precomputedFunctionStatus ?? BuildConfiguredFunctionStatus(...)` to skip re-computation when data is provided.
- Belt-and-suspenders guard: `BuildDoctorJson` independently checks `configuredFunctionStatus.All(s => s.Found || s.ResolutionReason is null)` before calling `DiagnoseMissingCommands`, so standalone callers still get diagnosis but the `RunDoctorAsync` path doesn't double-execute.
- `ConfiguredFunctionStatus` promoted from `private` to `internal` — necessary for the type to appear in `BuildDoctorJson`'s parameter list. Safe: sealed record, assembly-scoped.

**Rejection lockout pattern validated:** Hermes wrote the bug, was locked out, Bender delivered the fix cleanly. Pattern works — fresh eyes caught what the original author missed.



### 2026-07-15: Authored 4 new team skills from history review

Skills created: worktree-pr-merge, precomputed-optional-parameter, unserializable-type-handling, cli-bool-flag-pattern.
All at confidence: medium (except unserializable-type-handling: high — 33 tests).
Source: earned patterns from PRs #92–#96 and agent histories.

📌 Team update (2026-04-14T00:00:00Z): Docs publishing now uses a dedicated GitHub Pages workflow with docs-only path trigger and prebuilt `docs/_site` artifact strategy — decided by Amy.



### 2026-07-15: MCP Resources and Prompts spec authored

**Spec:** `specs/002-mcp-resources-and-prompts/spec.md`




### 2026-04-17: Spec restructure — loose specs → speckit format

**What was done:**
- Rewrote `specs/powershell-interactive-input.md`, `specs/out-of-process-execution.md`, and `specs/large-result-performance.md` into the speckit format (matching specs 001 and 002)
- Created `specs/003-powershell-interactive-input/spec.md`, `specs/004-out-of-process-execution/spec.md`, `specs/005-large-result-performance/spec.md`
- Numbering: FR-035–FR-064, SC-016–SC-030; next available FR-065, SC-031

**Patterns noted:**
- Original loose specs were RFC-style design docs (implementation code, C# classes, architecture diagrams) — speckit strips all of that; requirements must be written from user perspective with no class names
- The stateless retry pattern (Option D in the interactive input RFC) is the correct architecture for prompt handling given MCP's request/response model — captured as the design assumption in spec 003
- "Fail-fast" is the right default for prompt behavior; structured prompt response is P2 (requires fail-fast infrastructure first)
- Property filtering via `DefaultDisplayPropertySet` should be ON by default (95%+ payload reduction); result caching via `Tee-Object` should be OFF by default (most callers never use replay tools)
- Spec 003 (prompt handling) logically precedes spec 004 (OOP) because the OOP interactive prompt strategy is defined as "defer to spec 003 / fail-fast in OOP mode"



### 2026-07-18: PR #130 review — approved (MimeType nullable fix)

**PR:** #130 (fixes #129) — `Fix MimeType default — null model property, apply text/plain at runtime in handler`
**Verdict:** APPROVED

**Pattern validated — "model reflects truth, handler applies default":**
- `McpResourceConfiguration.MimeType` changed from `string` (default `"text/plain"`) to `string?` (no default)
- Runtime fallback `?? "text/plain"` applied via `string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace()` in `McpResourceHandler` at both list and read response sites
- Validator already used `IsNullOrWhiteSpace` — no change needed there
- All 3 `.MimeType` access sites in server code audited and confirmed null-safe
- Edge cases (empty string, whitespace) handled by `IsNullOrWhiteSpace` in both handler and validator
- No serialization cascade — MimeType is consumed, never re-serialized from the model
- Build: 0 errors; Tests: 471 passed, 0 failed

**Key pattern:** When a config property has a protocol-level default, keep the model nullable to distinguish "not configured" from "explicitly configured to the default value". Apply the default at the last responsible moment (the handler constructing the response).


### 2026-04-18: PR #130 review (issue #129 — MimeType fix)

**Verdict:** ✅ APPROVED
**Summary:** MimeType model nullable change restores validator signal while maintaining runtime fallback behavior. All 471 tests pass, 0 build warnings. Validator correctly flags missing MimeType in config; handler provides runtime "text/plain" default in HandleListAsync and HandleReadAsync.
**Key takeaway:** Model defaults that prevent validators from firing should be moved to runtime handlers. This preserves diagnostic signals while keeping runtime contracts stable.



### 2026-07-18: Issue #131 triage — STDIO logging to file

**Decisions made:**
- Use Serilog (Serilog.Extensions.Hosting + Serilog.Sinks.File) as the file logging provider; no existing file logger in the project, Serilog is the idiomatic .NET choice
- In stdio mode: `builder.Logging.ClearProviders()` unconditionally, then add Serilog file sink only if a log file path is configured — silent by default, no startup failure
- Log file resolution priority: `--log-file` CLI > `POSHMCP_LOG_FILE` env var > `Logging.File.Path` appsettings key > silent
- OTel `AddConsoleExporter()` suppressed in stdio mode by passing `isStdioMode` flag to `ConfigureOpenTelemetry`; HTTP path unchanged
- HTTP transport logging behavior is entirely unchanged
- Pre-startup `Console.Error.WriteLine` error paths stay as-is (correct for CLI errors before stdio server starts)

**Branch created:** `squad/131-stdio-logging-to-file`

**Agents assigned:**
- **Bender** — C# implementation: `Program.cs` changes, Serilog wiring, `--log-file` CLI option, `POSHMCP_LOG_FILE` env var, unit + integration tests
- **Amy** — OTel console suppression, `appsettings.json` schema (`Logging.File.Path`), documentation (README.md, DOCKER.md, appsettings.environment-example.json)

**GitHub note:** Label addition and issue comment blocked by Enterprise Managed User policy — triage notes saved to `.squad/decisions/inbox/farnsworth-131-stdio-logging-design.md` instead.



### 2026-07-18: PR #132 review — approved (STDIO logging suppression)

**PR:** #132 (fixes #131) — `feat: suppress console logging in stdio transport, add Serilog file sink`
**Verdict:** APPROVED

**Implementation quality:** Clean match to design spec. Bender handled C# changes (ConfigureStdioLogging, ResolveLogFilePath, CLI option, Serilog wiring), Amy handled OTel suppression, appsettings schema, and documentation. No merge conflicts expected.

**Key validation points:**
- `ClearProviders()` is unconditionally first in `ConfigureStdioLogging` — correct
- Serilog packages updated to 10.0.0/10.0.0/7.0.0 (newer than spec's 9.0.0/9.0.0/6.0.0) — correct per spec guidance
- OTel `AddConsoleExporter()` properly gated by `isStdioMode` flag
- 3-tier resolution (CLI > env > config > silent) works correctly
- HTTP transport completely unaffected
- 10 new tests (7 unit + 3 functional), all pass; full suite 487/0/1

**Non-blocking notes:**
- `default.appsettings.json` (embedded) missing `Logging.File.Path` — absent = silent, functionally correct
- Root handler (bare `poshmcp`) doesn't resolve `POSHMCP_LOG_FILE` — legacy path, low priority
- Pattern: `CreateLoggerFactory` didn't need changes because it's never called from the stdio server path — design spec was overcautious on this point



### 2026-07-18: PR #134 review — approved (docker buildx missing build context path)

**PR:** #134 (fixes #133) — `fix(#133): add missing build context path to docker buildx build command`
**Verdict:** APPROVED (comment posted — GitHub blocked self-review via API)

**Fix:** Single-character change: added ` .` to the end of `buildArgs` in the `buildCommand.SetHandler` lambda in `Program.cs` line 692.

**Validation points:**
- Bug is real: `docker build` requires a PATH argument for the build context; without it the command fails unconditionally
- `File.Exists(imageFile)` guard before the build args line implicitly validates CWD — if CWD were wrong, the Dockerfile check exits early with `ExitCodeConfigError`; by the time `.` is appended, CWD is the repo root
- Consistent with entire codebase: `docker.ps1` (3 sites), `docker.sh`, `infrastructure/azure/deploy.ps1`, `infrastructure/azure/deploy.sh` all use `.` as build context
- CI (`publish-packages.yml`) invokes from repo root — no CWD surprise

**Pattern noted:** When a CLI tool wraps an external command, every required positional argument must be present in the assembled arg string. The `File.Exists` guard doubles as implicit CWD validation — a pattern worth documenting for future Docker command wrappers.



### 2026-04-20: Spec 006 — Doctor Output Restructure milestone created

**Actions taken:**
1. Renamed `specs/doctor-output-restructure/` → `specs/006-doctor-output-restructure/` via git mv, added spec number to frontmatter, committed and pushed to main.
2. Created GitHub milestone #3: "Spec 006 - Doctor Output Restructure" (https://github.com/usepowershell/PoshMcp/milestone/3).

- Phase 8 (Cleanup/Validation): T024=#163, T025=#164, T026=#165, T027=#166

**Note:** Push to main required rebase to remove a pre-existing merge commit (a77dfcc) that violated repo rules.



### 2026-07-28: PR #167 review — approved (Spec 006: Doctor Output Restructure)

**PR:** #167 — `feat(spec-006): restructure doctor output`
**Verdict:** ✅ APPROVED (comment — self-approval blocked by GitHub)

**Implementation quality:** Clean match to spec 006. Architecture is solid: `DoctorReport` (pure data model with records + `[JsonPropertyName]`), `DoctorTextRenderer` (static class, pure rendering), `Program.cs` (thin orchestration). Build: 0 errors. Tests: 520 passed, 0 failed, 7 skipped.

**Spec compliance verified:**
- Banner: `╔═══╗` box-drawing chars, `BannerInnerWidth = 42`, correct status symbols (✓/⚠/✗)
- Section headers: `── Name ──` format, padded to 44 chars
- JSON: 7 top-level keys match FR-106, `effectivePowerShellConfiguration` dropped, camelCase throughout
